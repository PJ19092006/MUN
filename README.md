# MUN PROJECT

<p>This project is a Model United Nations (MUN) platform built using <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, <strong>Bootstrap</strong>, and <strong>JavaScript</strong> on the front end, with <strong>Node.js</strong> managing the backend. The project also incorporates <strong>Nodemailer</strong> for sending emails. To make the email functionality work, a fake SMTP service like <strong>Ethereal</strong> has been used. You can replace it with your preferred SMTP service for production.</p>
